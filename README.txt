Allows running a fully multilingual WordPress website using a simple on page language switcher without duplication of content.


== Description ==

Simple Multilingual (SML) is a minamilist plugin that allows users to easily create multilingual content for WordPress websites. The main differentiator for SML is the ability to add multilingual content to your pages without having to duplicate pages and content. A simple custom delimiter will seperate the text in different languages. The appropriate text is then displayed according to the user selection on the language switcher.

You can use as many languages as you wish. RTL languages are supported. No need for language packs, or add-ons. You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, and widgets.

The language is set in the plugin settings page by enserting a comma seperated list of languages that you wish to use by using ISO alpha-2 two character language codes. The order of the languages in this list must be followed throughout the site. For exemple, if you add the languages (en, fr) you will have to insert the english text and then the French text in the site content.
